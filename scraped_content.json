    "link": "https://rtcamp.com/case-studies/building-embedded-web-stories-for-wordpress/",
    "content": "The story format promotes magazine-style visual storytelling by packaging content in an immersive viewport that works well on mobile & desktop. Brands have better engagement, conversion & content flexibility using the format. Not surprisingly, it is massively popular through Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and other social networks.\n\nAlthough the format itself is appealing, the way most platforms implement stories has issues around accessibility and ephemerality. Additionally, some of these platforms limit story’s full functionality to their native mobile apps, even if they have fully functional websites.\n\nWe love stories as a format for their unique distraction-free experience. So when we received an opportunity to collaborate with Google for Web Stories, we were more than thrilled.\n\nGoogle’s Web Stories takes the immersive story format out of the confines of mobile apps and brings it to the open web. Every Web Story lives alongside other content and conforms exactly to your brand guidelines. The visual storytelling format works well for a wide range of categories like entertainment, food, how-to, listicles, and more. The possibilities to remix & reuse content is endless.\n\nWeb Stories are backed by Google and are discoverable from Google Search, News & Discover. Outside the confines of social media platforms, the stories format can both re-engaging your audience, as well as widen it.\n\nSince Web Stories are long-lived and you can monetize them through ads, they will naturally fit into your existing content strategy.\n\nGoogle’s Web Stories Editor for WordPress plugin makes it easy to create and manage stories straight from your WordPress dashboard and publish them to a platform that you fully control.\n\nPartnering with rtCamp has been key to the success of several important projects for us. Their WordPress ecosystem insights, engineering expertise, user focus, and super high-quality output have been the perfect combination to complement our efforts in developing tooling for the WordPress ecosystem.\n\nAlberto Medina\n\nDeveloper Relations\n\nFor the Web Stories for WordPress v1.5 release, rtCamp collaborated with Google to make it easier to embed stories anywhere on your WordPress site via familiar Gutenberg blocks, the TinyMCE (aka Classic) Editor, sidebar widgets, shortcodes, and PHP template tags. This greatly extends the presentational flexibility, so that you can embed your inventory of stories exactly as you see fit.\n\nrtCamp also developed a WordPress Customizer API that helps developers display web stories in theme-specific areas. Since the API extends the native WordPress Customizer, Web Stories are fully portable between themes with support.\n\nThe plugin code supports all default WordPress themes, right from recent TwentyTwentyOne to TwentyTen. Furthermore, Astra, Neve, Newspack, which are some of the most popular names in the WP ecosystem, have added native integrations for Web Stories through this API.\n\nWeb Stories are built using Google’s AMP technology for consistently great load time and performance. They are fully functional both on AMP and non-AMP websites.\n\nWeb stories in action. These are reused straight out of our careers section, where they appear quite differently. This is the kind of ease of use and flexibility that Web Stories within Gutenberg blocks give creators.\n\nrtCamp set up a demo website to showcase the flexibility of Web Stories for WordPress. The website received a lot of traffic at launch, an indicator of the interest in the project from people & brands.\n\nGoogle’s Web Stories for WordPress rollout went through flawlessly. As of writing, there are over 20,000 active installs of the plugin. And through ongoing releases like these, Google Web Stories will keep getting better and better.\n\nIf your brand is evaluating stories as a format, we’d be happy to help navigate the landscape – right from content strategy to implementation. Or, if you belong to one of those cutting-edge publishing houses that have invested in an in-house story format, we can help you replatform to Google’s Web Stories for better discoverability, performance, and monetization opportunities.\n\nConnect with our experts today and start optimizing your story format for better discoverability.\n\n"

    "content": "FleetNet America Inc., is a leading provider of fleet repair and maintenance services for both private and commercial fleets. They also operate a Towing and Recovery program, for incident management and accident management. FleetNet America manages its extensive network of over 60,000 service providers through its Roadside and TMcare® programs.\n\nFleetNet America (FNA) was hosted on Acquia, using Drupal version 9. FNA approached us to move their site to WordPress, which was the primary platform in the existing multisite structure of Cox Automotive network of websites.\n\nFNA’s primary objective was to ensure a smooth transition to WordPress without disrupting the current website’s design, while protecting their SEO performance. Any UI/UX enhancements were planned for post-migration. Thus, we were required to do the lift & shift, and make sure that the site retained its current appearance post migration.\n\nAdditionally, FNA expected us to facilitate a smooth onboarding process and orientation for their teams.\n\nUnlike WordPress, Drupal uses an entity reference module to build relationships between the entities, whereas WordPress uses categories and tags for taxonomy.\n\nWe began with a comprehensive understanding of FNA’s current website structure, content types, and taxonomies. This helped us conduct the data analysis to devise a comprehensive plan for mapping and organizing data.\n\nOnce the mapping was done, we deployed automation with scripts to migrate most of the content, including taxonomies and meta-data. Additionally, we undertook manual efforts for edge cases.\n\nFNA aimed to harness the potential of Gutenberg based full site editor for efficient content creation and management. It was imperative that the new WordPress theme and setup fully supported Gutenberg blocks and features.\n\nTo achieve this objective, we leveraged the full site editor to simplify content creation and management. Gutenberg blocks streamlined content processes, made it easier for new users to learn quickly, and reduced the time they needed to learn.\n\nAs additional support, we delivered tailored editorial orientation and training for FNA team, empowering them with a flexible and user-friendly content creation environment.\n\nWe imported the SEO meta from the existing to the new system with Yoast, and ensured that the URL structure is retained. In cases where it was not possible to maintain the old URL structure, we implemented redirection rules.\n\nAn important contributing factor to improved SEO is performance. FNA achieved an improvement of Core Web Vitals by ~2X. rtCamp monitored the performance benchmark of the site before and after the migration.\n\nThe newly migrated website was to be integrated into the existing WordPress Multisite environment on WordPress VIP to align with Cox Automotive’s goals of global compliance, standardization, and budget efficiency.\n\nMigrating an additional site into an existing Multisite environment requires careful planning and execution. To ensure a seamless import of the microsite, we meticulously verified that all data, including pages and media assets, were transferred without any loss.\n\nrtCamp’s remarkable Drupal to WordPress migration, completed in just a few weeks, was a game-changer for FleetNet America. Their expertise transformed our online presence, elevating user experience and functionality. This initiative had a noteworthy business impact, with a 2x increase in performance. WordPress, known for its versatility, proved to be an excellent choice for our Enterprise B2B needs.\n\nSamantha Blum\n\nDigital Marketing Manager\n\nIf you have a project that can use our expertise, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.\n\n"

Here’s how QE services might apply and differ across these three types of companies:Startups often prioritize speed and innovation, leading to fast and agile development cycles. Quality Engineering (QE) services for startups focus on establishing basic testing processes and automating critical tests early on to ensure product stability during rapid iterations. The primary goal is to quickly identify and resolve bugs to keep pace with development demands. Startups require flexible and adaptable QE practices, as their products and processes are still evolving. Additionally, due to budget constraints, startups prioritize cost-effective tools and solutions.Mid-size companies typically have more established products and development processes, allowing QE services to focus on scaling testing efforts, ensuring comprehensive coverage, and enhancing the efficiency of the development lifecycle. At this stage, there’s a balance between automation and manual testing, with an increasing emphasis on integrating testing into the CI/CD pipeline. As mid-size companies grow, QE services must scale to manage larger, more complex projects. Enterprises need comprehensive QE services to manage their complex systems, extensive user bases, and diverse technology stacks. The focus is on ensuring high reliability, security, and performance through extensive test coverage, advanced automation, and specialized testing such as performance, security, and compliance. Enterprises also require rigorous compliance testing and documentation to meet strict regulatory standards.\n\n"

    "title": "Why test automation strategies fall apart",
    "date": "2025-02-21T05:07:45+00:00",
    "link": "https://rtcamp.com/blog/test-automation-failure-causes/",
    "content": "Test automation is one of the well-known approaches for its ability to optimize testing pipelines, providing instant and parallel feedback to developers by giving them real-time insights into what’s working and what’s not. However, as highlighted in Capgemini’s 14th Edition World Quality Report, many organizations fail to unlock its full potential due to a weak strategy, unrealistic expectations, or technical limitations.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore the core reasons why test automation strategies fail at both the business and team levels. We’ll also share actionable tips to help you navigate these challenges and harness test automation to its full potential.\n\nDid you know that out of 90% of organizations have less than 40% automation coverage, and 26% have 20% or less coverage? What’s holding them back?\n\nLet’s explore the test automation challenges that hamper delivering full value.\n\nMany organizations treat test automation as a “set-it-and-forget-it” investment. The reality is that test automation is as dynamic as the software it tests—constant updates, UI tweaks, backend changes, and shifts in external dependencies mean that a test suite that works today may fail tomorrow.\n\nFor example, in a Content Management System (CMS), new user roles or content types might be introduced, or existing UI elements may be redesigned. When teams fail to update their automation coverage to validate these changes, critical content errors or UI inconsistencies can slip through unnoticed, leading to customer dissatisfaction and brand damage.\n\n✅ Dedicate resources to continually maintain and evolve your automation framework.\n\n✅ Integrate automated tests into your CI/CD pipeline so they evolve in step with your product.\n\n✅ Conduct regular audits to refactor flaky tests and update outdated scenarios.\n\nTest automation tools are crucial in a test automation strategy, but they’re not the whole equation. They assist with execution and implementation, but even the best tools fall short without a solid strategy in place first. Yet, many businesses spend excessive time evaluating and comparing tools, hoping to find a silver bullet for automation success.\n\nAccording to Capgemini’s 14th Edition World Quality Report, which surveyed 750 organizations, only 19% effectively utilize their automation tools, highlighting that tools mean little in the overall testing strategy.\n\n✅ Define automation objectives and align test coverage with critical business workflows.\n\n✅ Evaluate test automation tools based on project requirements, not just vendor promises.\n\n✅ Validate with a Proof of Concept (PoC) before scaling up.\n\nSuccess isn’t measured by the sheer number of test cases automated. Many teams boast high automation counts yet miss critical workflows that drive real business value. With 26% of organizations citing ROI as a key factor, it’s clear that focusing on volume over impact leads to wasted effort.\n\nLet’s consider an example of an ecommerce platform that automated 90% of its tests—mostly low-change areas—while leaving essential checkout and payment flows unautomated. When an update caused a checkout failure, the coverage gap resulted in significant revenue loss.\n\n✅ Set success metrics that measure impact, such as “zero critical checkout failures in production.”\n\n✅ Prioritize automation for high-impact areas like transaction processing and API stability.\n\n✅ Continuously align automation goals with evolving business priorities.\n\nWhile organizations invest in automation, team-level test automation challenges often determine whether these efforts succeed or fail. Test automation teams often fall short of delivering expected gains from automation, and the probable causes behind are –\n\nTest automation falls apart when QA, development, and operations teams work in silos. When QA writes tests that the dev never sees—and Ops can’t deliver a stable environment—the result is a cascade of broken tests and wasted effort.\n\nRecognizing this challenge, many businesses have started bridging the gap. The 15th Edition WQR by Capgemini study of 314 respondents found that 56% of organizations are now fostering collaboration between business and testing teams to achieve an integrated and balanced approach to test automation.\n\n✅ Embed QA into development workflows so that automation evolves alongside code.✅ Adopt shift-left testing to catch issues early.✅ Standardize test environments by aligning test data and configurations across Dev, QA, and Ops.\n\nThere’s a common notion that automation should wait until a feature is complete.  While that may hold true for some UI components, delaying automation overall only slows feedback loops and hampers quality. Instead, by aligning automation efforts in parallel with development, we can catch issues as they happen.\n\nTake a betting application, for instance—where response times must be under 7 milliseconds and multiple PoCs are the norm. By writing automation scripts in parallel, we flag errors in real-time, saving debugging time and reinforcing stability. Remember that while UI automation may be deferred for highly dynamic interfaces, API and backend tests can run concurrently with development.\n\n✅ Develop your test automation strategy early—even if execution is staggered.✅ Leverage parallel automation as a real-time feedback mechanism.✅ Tailor your approach to the project’s needs.\n\nAccording to the 15th Edition of the WQR, 34% of organizations cite legacy systems as a major barrier to effective automation.  When test automation isn’t designed to adapt to aging infrastructure, teams face long execution times, frequent failures, and increased maintenance overhead.\n\nWithout a clear strategy for modernizing test coverage, automation efforts quickly become unreliable and unsustainable.\n\n✅ Start with high-impact test cases that yield the fastest ROI.✅ Build a centralized knowledge base that documents test architecture, framework decisions, and updates.✅ Standardize automation practices across the team to minimize redundancy.\n\nToo often, we treat automation as a “set-it-and-forget-it” effort. But just like code, test scripts need regular upkeep. Without a proactive maintenance plan, tests quickly become outdated—resulting in false positives and eroded trust.\n\n✅ Schedule regular audits to remove obsolete tests and update your framework.✅ Implement self-healing mechanisms to adapt to minor changes.✅ Store test scripts in version control and apply coding best practices.\n\nEarly wins are crucial—they build confidence, prove ROI, and pave the way for further investment in automation. When teams focus solely on long-term goals, they miss out on quick, impactful successes that can drive momentum.\n\nFor example, in a CMS-based project, automating UI regression tests across multiple devices slashed manual testing time significantly. That immediate improvement helped secure ongoing support for automation efforts.\n\n✅ Identify quick-impact test cases such as smoke tests and login workflows.✅ Quantify improvements—track time saved and defect reduction.✅ Use Proof of Concepts (PoCs) to demonstrate early success before scaling up.\n\nTest automation evolves rapidly, and so must our skills. Yet, many teams struggle to keep up with new tools and methodologies. The 15th Edition WQR survey reveals that 30% of respondents see a lack of skills as a key barrier to automation. There’s a continuous need to develop expertise to handle both legacy challenges and emerging technologies.\n\n✅ Invest in structured training—workshops, certifications, and internal learning resources.✅ Embrace innovative approaches like hackathons to expose your team to real-world challenges and foster a culture of continuous learning.✅ Encourage open-source contributions to keep pace with industry trends.\n\nShweta Sharma, our Director of Quality Engineering at rtCamp, puts it:\n\nTest automation requires continuous effort, collaboration, and a deep understanding of both the business and technical sides. It’s not about automating everything—it’s about automating what matters, and ensuring those automated tests evolve with the product. Done right, automation can drastically improve quality and efficiency, but it’s essential to approach it strategically, with ongoing maintenance and adaptability built in.\n\nReady to scale your test automation?\n\nAt rtCamp, our tailor-made Quality Engineering Service helps you build a sustainable, efficient test automation strategy that grows with your team.\n\nOn this page\n\nAuthored by\t\t\t\n\nAhad\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAhad Qureshi\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tContent Marketer – QE Services\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n|\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEdited by\t\t\t\t\t\tSimran\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSimran Sethi\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tContent Strategist\n\nContributions and Updates:\t\t\t\t\nShweta\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShweta Sharma\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDirector of Quality Engineering\n\nName*\n\nEmail*\n\nComment*\n\nSubmit\n\nΔ\n\n"

    "content": "Ready Logistics provides full-service transportation logistics solutions. It supports planning, execution, and overall improvement in logistics operations from point A to point B, serving automotive auctions, dealers, commercial, and consumer clients.\n\nA 6,500+ fully vetted carrier network utilizes Ready Logistics leading technology to provide end-to-end services for vehicle shipping needs of the automotive industry. Headquartered in Phoenix, AZ, Ready Logistics is a Cox Automotive™ brand.\n\nReady Logistics came up with the idea to partially redesign the website’s visual presence to improve their users’ experience. The website required an audit of theme and plugins for smoother operations. It also needed to be hosted on performant and secure WordPress VIP Go infrastructure.\n\nrtCamp’s creative team redesigned the web pages while maintaining the brand guidelines. During the redesign process, optimized UI/UX was ensured for better lead generation.\n\nrtCamp revamped Ready Logistics’ website with a focus on performance, UI/UX optimization, and enhanced lead generation. Here’s how we did it:\n\nrtCamp started the project by setting up a new staging site with all the plugins updated to the latest version. As the plan included this site to be hosted on WP VIP, all unnecessary plugins needed a cleanup. Each plugin was audited and only the necessary ones needed to keep the site functional were retained. Every database table was vetted, and redundant data was removed.\n\nrtCamp executed the migration process by re-importing the content and database from the old server to the new server. Thereafter, moved Ready Logistics from Liquid Web to the WordPress VIP infrastructure. The transition to WordPress VIP infrastructure offered Ready Logistics a reliable, scalable hosting solution to better accommodate their growing needs.\n\nrtCamp moved the custom-built HTML form, used for Get a Quote functionality, to Gravity Forms. It allowed customization and styling options with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. This was not possible with vanilla HTML forms. Features for data validation, conditional formatting and security vastly improved the form submission workflows.\n\nInitially, an integration with Salesforce Marketing Cloud was provided through Zapier. It enabled automated syncing of form entries, eliminating the need for manual data entry. This reduced errors and saved time for website administrators.\n\nEventually, the Zapier layer was removed, and syncing executes directly with Salesforce data extensions. It happens with our Gravity Forms-Salesforce integration add-on deployed. This further streamlines the process and reduces the risk of errors or delays.\n\nBy leveraging the data from Salesforce CRM, the website gets insights about lead generation and conversion rates. It helps to track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and other initiatives.\n\nHere’s what we have achieved :\n\nAfter the revamp, Ready Logistics saw a 49% increase in lead submissions, comparing the pre- and post-migration year periods.\n\nAfter migration and redesign, the website’s performance improved. rtCamp monitored the performance benchmark with the previous platform & compared it with the site after migration.  According to a survey, 47% of website visitors expect a web page to load in 2 seconds or less. An optimized UI/UX with speedy page loading makes for a better web experience.\n\nBefore the migration\n\nAfter the migration\n\nrtCamp was pivotal in modernizing the website for Ready Logistics, ultimately resulting in a better user experience for our clients and greater accessibility for our internal users to manage the website. Their expertise guided along during the process to ensure that we were optimizing the website for performance, updating the theme to improve user engagement, refining our backend lead generation workflow, as well as aligning our tech stack supporting the site with the rest of our solutions groups.\n\nLucas Collis\n\nManaging Director\n\nAre you not able to achieve your business goals with your existing CMS? WordPress VIP’s bulletproof infrastructure and rtCamp’s custom solutions can help you in serving your customers better.Explore our platform migration solutions and get in touch with us today.\n\n"
